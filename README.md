# Smart Garden Project

The Smart Garden Project focuses on creating an intelligent gardening system that measures and monitors temperature and humidity levels using an ESP32 microcontroller. The collected data is then published on the web, allowing the user to remotely monitor his garden's environmental conditions in real time. Additionally, I will design a custom PCB for the project using KiCad, enhancing my skills in both electronics and PCB design.

Learning Objectives

- Understand ESP32 Basics: Gain a solid understanding of the ESP32 microcontroller and its features.

- Measure Environmental Conditions: Learn how to integrate and use temperature and humidity sensors with the ESP32.

- Web Data Publishing: Understand how to send sensor data to a web server and display it in a user-friendly format.

- PCB Design with KiCad: Learn to design a custom PCB for the project using KiCad, from schematic creation to board layout.

- Enhance Problem-Solving Skills: Develop your problem-solving skills through troubleshooting and debugging both hardware and software components.
